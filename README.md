# OpenWeatherApp

A weather app I've been making for practice purposes using OpenWeatherApi. It still has features missing and needs a lot of polish but the core functionality works fine.

Used in this project:

- MVVM Architectural pattern
- Kotlin coroutines
- Architecture components
- Retrofit
- Hilt
- Location Services
- Places Api
- Picasso
- EasyPermissions
